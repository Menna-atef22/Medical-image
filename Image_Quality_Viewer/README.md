### Overview

The **Image Quality Viewer** is a powerful desktop tool designed for analyzing and improving the quality of medical and scientific images. It provides a range of features that allow users to enhance images, analyze noise, and measure image quality. This tool is perfect for researchers, doctors, and anyone who works with images and needs to ensure their quality is as high as possible.

With an easy-to-use interface, users can load, process, and compare images side by side. The application includes advanced features like **contrast improvement**, **noise addition**, and **image filtering**, along with important quality measurements such as **Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)** and **Contrast-to-Noise Ratio (CNR)**. These measurements help assess how clear and useful the images are, which is especially important in medical imaging for accurate diagnoses.
