# Image Quality Viewer ðŸ©º  

The Image Quality Viewer is a powerful desktop application designed for medical and scientific image analysis. It provides a comprehensive suite of tools for image enhancement, noise analysis, and quality assessment, making it ideal for researchers, medical professionals, and image processing specialists.  

This application enables users to load medical or scientific images and apply various processing techniques in real-time. With its intuitive interface featuring three display panels (Input, Output 1, Output 2), users can easily compare different processing results side by side.  

The tool supports advanced operations such as contrast enhancement, noise simulation, filtering, and quantitative measurements, including **SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio)** and **CNR (Contrast-to-Noise Ratio)** calculations, essential for medical image quality assessment.

## Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) ðŸ“Š  

**SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio)** is a key metric for assessing the quality of medical and scientific images. It measures the ratio of the mean signal intensity to the standard deviation of the noise, indicating the clarity of the image relative to noise.  

### SNR Formula  
The application calculates SNR using the formula:  
\[
\text{SNR} = \frac{\text{mean(signal)}}{\text{std(noise)}}
\]  

Where:  
- `mean(signal)` is the average intensity in the selected signal region.  
- `std(noise)` is the standard deviation of pixel intensities in the noise region.  

### How to Calculate SNR in the Application:  
1. Load an image using the **"Load Image"** button.  
2. Select **ROIs (Regions of Interest)** for the signal and noise areas:  
   - Use the cursor to draw rectangles around the regions you want to analyze.  
   - Assign the signal region (e.g., an area containing meaningful data).  
   - Assign the noise region (e.g., a background area).  
3. Click **"Calculate SNR"** in the control panel.  
4. The SNR value will be displayed in the analysis panel or console output.  

**Example**:  
- If the mean signal intensity is `100` and the standard deviation of noise is `10`, the SNR is calculated as:  
  \[
  \text{SNR} = \frac{100}{10} = 10
  \]
