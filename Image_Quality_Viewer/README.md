Image Quality Viewer ü©∫üñºÔ∏è
---
#### Overview

The **Image Quality Viewer** is a powerful desktop tool designed for analyzing and improving the quality of medical and scientific images. It provides a range of features that allow users to enhance images, analyze noise, and measure image quality. This tool is perfect for researchers, doctors, and anyone who works with images and needs to ensure their quality is as high as possible.

With an easy-to-use interface, users can load, process, and compare images side by side. The application includes advanced features like **contrast improvement**, **noise addition**, and **image filtering**, along with important quality measurements such as **Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)** and **Contrast-to-Noise Ratio (CNR)**. These measurements help assess how clear and useful the images are, which is especially important in medical imaging for accurate diagnoses.

- **High-Pass Filter**: Highlight edges and fine details.

### Analysis Tools
- **Real-time Histogram Visualization**: Dynamic histogram of the image to analyze pixel distribution.
- **SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio) Calculation**: Measure the ratio of useful signal to noise.
- **CNR (Contrast-to-Noise Ratio) Calculation**: Evaluate the contrast to noise ratio for image quality assessment.

## Required Libraries

To run the application, install the following libraries:

```bash
pip install PyQt5
pip install opencv-python
pip install numpy
pip install matplotlib
 ```
## Usage

### 1.Run the Application:
To run the application, use the following command:

```bash
python ImageQ.py
```

### 2.Basic Operations:
- **Click "Load Image"** to open an image file from your system.
- **Select the source image** (Input/Output1/Output2) from the dropdown menu.
- **Choose the target output window** (Output1/Output2) where the processed image will be displayed.
- **Apply desired operations** using the control panel to modify the image.

### 3.Enhancement Operations:
- **Select enhancement type** (Histogram Equalization/CLAHE/Gamma Correction) from the available options.
- **Click "Enhance Contrast"** to apply the selected enhancement.
- **Adjust brightness/contrast** using the sliders to modify the image's brightness and contrast.
- **Click "Apply B/C"** to apply the changes made to brightness and contrast.

### 4.Noise and Filtering:
- **Select noise type** (Gaussian/Salt and Pepper/Speckle) to add noise to the image.
- **Click "Add Noise"** to apply the selected noise type.
- **Select filter type** (Gaussian/Bilateral/Non-Local Means/Low-Pass/High-Pass) from the filter options.
- **Click "Add Filter"** to apply the selected filter to the image.


### 5.Analysis:
- **Click "Show Histogram"** to view the intensity distribution of the current image.
- **Use "Calculate SNR"** to measure the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) of the image.
- **Use "Calculate CNR"** to measure the Contrast-to-Noise Ratio (CNR) of the image.

 ### Quality Metrics

#### 1. SNR Calculation:
1. **Select ROIs** (Regions of Interest) for the signal and noise regions.
2. The application calculates the **Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)** using the formula:
   - `SNR = mean(signal) / std(noise)`
3. This calculation provides a measure of the signal strength relative to the background noise.

#### 2. CNR Calculation:
1. **Select ROIs** for two regions and one noise region.
2. The **Contrast-to-Noise Ratio (CNR)** is calculated using the formula:
   - `CNR = |mean(region1) - mean(region2)| / std(noise)`
3. CNR helps assess the difference in contrast between two regions relative to the noise in the image.

### Interface Components

#### 1. **Main Display Area**:
- The application features **three image panels**:
  - **Input**: Displays the original image that will be modified.
  - **Output1**: Displays the image after applying the operations (e.g., contrast enhancement).
  - **Output2**: Displays another version of the image after applying different modifications or effects.

  You can choose which of these panels will display the original or modified image.

#### 2. **Control Panel**:
- The application has a control panel with several tools that allow you to apply various operations to the image:
  - **Dropdowns**: To select the type of operation you want to apply (e.g., contrast enhancement or noise addition).
